(ha)doop   (from the OED)

noun/verb: fool. from geoffrey chaucer "treatise on database"(1378).
past participle/adjective dooped. pronounced doop-ed. rhymes with stupid.
from old french: doupe (unreliable. expensive to set up and maintain.)


i recently bumped into cloudera's chief technologist. (i live close to stanford.)
asked him if they had put indices into impala yet. he said no. they do table scans.

nice! so on one trillion quotes:

select last bid from quote where sym=`IBM

takes 450 seconds (impala with 100 big memory machines on AWS. all data cached in ram.)
versus 25 microseconds (k on one machine).

more than 7 orders of magnitude with 10-100 times the cost. 

hadoop is also not great with table scans, e.g.

select avg bid from quote

takes  450 seconds (impala on 100 big memory machines)
versus 120 seconds (k on one machine. 12 seconds on 10 machines.)

some quotes on hadoop: (unknown provenance?)

"maximize latency while simultaneously minimizing throughput"
"the corba of distributed database"
"charity for amazon"
