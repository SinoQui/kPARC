it would take 1000 machines (expensive and unreliable) for hadoop (e.g. cloudera/impala) 
to perform trillion row tick database queries (Q2&Q3) as fast as k does on a single machine.

there is no number of hadoop machines that can do point selects(e.g. Q1) as fast as k.

since minimum hadoop overhead is >100,000 microseconds.

k point selects are roughly 20 microseconds. (1 microsecond for small (<1TB) databases)

impala can't do timeseries merge(asof join) like Q4
