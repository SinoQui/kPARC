disk space for trillion rows:
k5  22TB (when we have compressed maybe about 5TB)
q3  24TB (5TB compressed)

7000 syms (S: top 100 syms)

 960 billion quotes (S has 170 billion. QQQ has 6 billion.)
  48 billion trades (S has 12 billion. QQQ has 80 million.)

Q1:{select last bid  by sym         from quote where date=x,sym in S}peach D
Q2:{select max price by sym,ex      from trade where date=x,sym in S}peach D
Q3:{select avg size  by sym,time.hh from trade where date=x,sym in S}peach D
Q4:{select time,price,bid from aj[`time;select from trade where date=x,sym=`QQQ;select from quote where sym=`QQQ]where price<bid}peach D

Q2 and Q3 are simple sql groupby aggregations. each has to read 2 or 3 columns in 12 billion rows.
Q1 (last) only requires reading the length of the sym section and extracting the last bid. e.g. 200 pages per day.

k&q both scale nicely with additional cores and hyperthreads.

e.g. on our 16 core machine:

16 days runs only 2 times slower than 1 day.
32 days runs only 3 times slower than 1 day.

all tested software has indices except impala/parquet.
